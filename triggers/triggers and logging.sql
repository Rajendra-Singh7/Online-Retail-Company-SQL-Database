--LOG MAINTENANCE

/*Let's create additional queries that involve updating, deleting, and maintaining logs of these operations 
in the OnlineRetailDB database. 

To automatically log changes in the database, we use triggers in SQL Server. 

We'll start by adding a table to keep logs of updates and deletions.

Step 1: Create a Log Table
Step 2: Create Triggers for Each Table
	
	A. Triggers for Products Table
		-- Trigger for INSERT on Products table
		-- Trigger for UPDATE on Products table
		-- Trigger for DELETE on Products table

	B. Triggers for Customers Table
		-- Trigger for INSERT on Customers table
		-- Trigger for UPDATE on Customers table
		-- Trigger for DELETE on Customers table
